1. Original and the cloned object will point to the same objects in memory.
2. Any changes made to the cloned object will be reflected in the original object and vice versa.
3. Default version of the clone() method creates a shallow copy.
4. Shallow cloning is preferred if the objectâ€™s fields are only primitive types.
5. It is faster and uses less memory compared to deep cloning.

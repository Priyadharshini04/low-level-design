/*
1. Creates a new object and recursively copies all fields, including nested objects. This ensures that the cloned object and the original object are completely independent of each other.
2. Any changes made to the cloned object will not be reflected in the original object.
3. To create a deep copy, you need to override the clone() method.
4. Deep cloning is preferred if the objectâ€™s fields contain references to other objects.
5. It is slower and uses more memory because it duplicates all objects and their nested objects.
